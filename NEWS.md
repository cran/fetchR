# fetchR 2.0-0

## Major changes

* **fetchR** is now generalised to incorporate `SpatialPolyons` representing any
marine location on Earth (#6). As a result, **fetchR* 2.0 is no longer limited 
to calculating wind fetch within New Zealand coastal areas.

### Rewrite the entire algorithm for calculating wind fetch. 

* The `rgeos::gBuffer` function is used to calculate the end points of the fetch 
vectors at their maximum distance.

* The interactions between the fetch vectors and the coastlines, or any of the 
polygons, are calculated with the `rgeos::gIntersection` function as opposed to
the slow, iterative algorithm used by the package's predecessors.

* Computation times are dramatically decreased.
